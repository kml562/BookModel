#  Books Management Project -

The Technetium Books Management project is a web application designed to manage books and user reviews. It provides a set of APIs for user registration, login, book creation, book retrieval, book updating, book deletion, and book reviews. The project aims to facilitate efficient management of books and enable users to share their reviews and ratings.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main models:

1. User Model: Represents user information, including title, name, contact details, address, and timestamps for creation and update.

2. Books Model: Represents book information, including title, excerpt, user ID, ISBN, category, subcategory, review count, deletion status, release date, and timestamps for creation and update.

3. Review Model: Represents book reviews, including the book ID, reviewer's name, review timestamp, rating, review text, deletion status, and timestamps for creation and update.
